<p> Some notes:</p>
<ul><li>These numbers do not match exactly with the number of new infections reported in the media (Likely due to a difference between midnight to midnight vs 8pm to 8pm reporting)</li><li>The most recent day is a partial day, only containing data up to 8pm, and is semi-transparent to reflect this</li><li>The underlying dataset is updated at ~2:30pm on weekdays, with data from up to ~8pm of the previous day</li><li>Cases without a specified local health district are placed in the "Not Listed" category</li><li>It is assumed that each row of the dataset corresponds to a single case</li><li>As noted in the original dataset, the reported location is based on the usual residence of the case, not the location of infection.</li><li>As noted in the original dataset, some cases, such as crews of ships docked in NSW are not part of this dataset</li><li>Only the previous 14 days are displayed to keep the visualisation readable</li></ul><p>The visualisation was produced as follows:</p>
